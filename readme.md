#### Summary

 * Personal website. I wanted it to be fast, simple and practical. Focus is on giving button links with various <b>actions</b> using just HTML i.e. call my phone number with a compatible device/app on your system, click to see my Github. In total there are at least 7 ways to contact me, ways to pay me or buy me gifts and one wikipedia article to learn some about my heritage.
 
 * Technically/design wise, I wanted it to be mobile friendly, and this lead me to actually emulating a mobile phone with app-like buttons. See Credits for original CSS frame.
 
 * On the fun side, the website has a very basic Service Worker enabling it for offline use. You can try it yourself by visiting my website offline and after refreshing your cache. The website should load with a blank screen (Im working on something fun for this)
